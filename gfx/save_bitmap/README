The examples in the below subdirectories demonstrate how to simply
write contents of a pixel buffer (framebuffer) to a bitmap file.

The actual code for saving bitmaps is meant to be completely
independent of external libraries.  Thus no zlib or libpng should be
used for writing pngs.  This is done in order to provide for hassle
free compiling, especially on Windows where libraries are difficult to
install.
