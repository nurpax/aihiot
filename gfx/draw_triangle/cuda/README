
Building
--------

Batch files are provided to compile for Windows.  Adaptation for Unix
shells should be fairly trivial.

To build for CUDA emulator (this is the default), run:

m.bat emu

To build for the real device, run:

m.bat hw

Consult CUDA SDK for more build instructions.

Running
-------

Run r.bat.  If you have all the SDK elements properly in your PATH,
you should be able to run the executable directly without the batch
file.
